Warning detected by hpeesofsim in LinearCollapse '_2_' during analysis.
    LinearCollapse is disabled because there is 'DC' analysis present.

DC Q1.DC1[1] <BJT-bias_lib:BJT-param:schematic>  
.Pt DC convergence is used.

.

DC convergence achieved in 76 iterations.

SP SP1[1] <BJT-bias_lib:BJT-param:schematic>   freq=5.4 GHz
.Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP1'.
    The simulation temperature (25.0 C) is not the same as the IEEE standard
    noise temperature (290 K or 16.85 C) in the noise analysis `SP1'.
    If the simulation temperature is not equal to the IEEE standard temperature,
    then the loss and the noise figure will not agree for a passive circuit.
    The `Temp' parameter on the Options item can be set to 16.85 C to
    eliminate this warning message.
